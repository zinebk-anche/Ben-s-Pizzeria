Ben is the proud owner of **Ben's Pizza**, a local favorite known for its delicious wood-fired pizzas and warm atmosphere. As part of his commitment to improving his business, Ben has asked us to analyze some key aspects of the pizzeria‚Äôs operations during January 2023.

## Ben's Request

Ben has tasked us with analyzing various data points to help him make informed decisions about his pizzeria. He wants to know:

1. **Which items are the most popular** on the menu and how they correlate with customer orders.
2. **How much inventory** of each ingredient is used during the week and whether Ben needs to adjust his supply levels.
3. **Staff performance analysis**, looking at how shifts are scheduled and whether labor costs align with business needs.

## The Menu

Ben has an extensive menu with pizzas, sides, and drinks that are loved by the community. Below is the **menu** that we will be analyzing for business insights:
