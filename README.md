Ben is the proud owner of **Ben's Pizza**, a local favorite known for its delicious wood-fired pizzas and warm atmosphere. As part of his commitment to improving his business, Ben has asked us to analyze some key aspects of the pizzeria‚Äôs operations during January 2023.

## Ben's Request

Ben has tasked us with analyzing various data points to help him make informed decisions about his pizzeria. He wants to know:

1. **Which items are the most popular** on the menu and how they correlate with customer orders.
2. **How much inventory** of each ingredient is used during the week and whether Ben needs to adjust his supply levels.
3. **Staff performance analysis**, looking at how shifts are scheduled and whether labor costs align with business needs.

## The Menu

Ben has an extensive menu with pizzas, sides, and drinks that are loved by the community. Below is the **menu** that we will be analyzing for business insights:

The menu offers a wide variety of pizzas with different sizes, toppings, and prices. Our analysis will help Ben understand which items are performing well and which might need adjustments based on customer preferences.

</p>

**Analysis**:
1. **Overall Performance:**
   - A total orders number of 1,091 with total sales of $57.54K indicates a healthy revenue stream for January 2023.
2. **High-Performing Items:**
   - Pizza Diavola Large and Pizza Napolitana Large dominate sales, likely due to their popularity and high margins.
Seafood pizzas (large and regular) and Quattro Formaggi also perform well.

3. **District Performance:**
   - Manhattan is the top-performing district, contributing significantly to overall sales.
   - Other districts, such as Staten Island and Queens, have room for growth.
    
4. **Peak Hours:**
   -Sales peak around 11 PM to 1 PM during lunchtime and again at 7 PM to 10e PM during dinner. This consistent pattern indicates that consumers are most likely to make purchases during their lunch breaks and after-work hours.
     
4. **Delivery:**
   - 60.2% of customers prefer delivery, indicating a heavy reliance on logistics and delivery services.

**Recommendations for Ben:**
1. **Capitalize on Top Performers:**
   - Focus marketing efforts on highly performing pizzas like Pizza Diavola and Napolitana, offering combo deals or limited-time promotions to increase sales.
     
2. **Expand in Low-Performing Districts:**
   - Launch targeted campaigns and promotions in Staten Island, Queens, and Brooklyn to boost visibility and sales.
   - Partner with delivery platforms or local businesses to increase market penetration.
     
3. **Address Afternoon Sales Dip:**
   - Introduce afternoon specials or happy hour deals to encourage orders during off-peak hours (2 PM - 5 PM).
   - Bundle lower-demand pizzas with beverages or sides to attract budget-conscious customers.
     
4. **Enhance Delivery Operations:**
   - Offer delivery incentives, such as discounts for first-time customers or free delivery above a certain order value.
     
5. **Leverage Manhattan‚Äôs Strength:**
   - Introduce a loyalty program in Manhattan to retain existing customers and further boost sales.
  
## Inventory Analysis

**Objectives**: 
- Identify which ingredients need to be replenished urgently to maintain smooth pizza production.
- Highlight the most expensive pizzas to make and analyze their profitability.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/inventory.png" alt="Inventory 2" width="700" />
</p>

**Analysis**:
  1. **Ingredients Running Low:**
  - 22 ingredients have less than 15% of their stock remaining, including mozzarella, pizza dough, and tomato sauce‚Äîkey ingredients used in most pizzas.
  - Without replenishment, production of high-demand pizzas like Margherita and Pepperoni could be disrupted.
    
  2. **High-Cost Ingredients:**
  - Mozzarella cheese and pizza dough are the most expensive ingredients, primarily because they are essential for every pizza.
  - Seafood toppings (used in Seafood pizza) and the different kinds of cheeses (used in Quattro Formaggi) are also among the most expensive.

  3. **Most Expensive Pizzas to Make:**
  - The Seafood Pizza and Quattro Formaggi Pizza have the highest production costs but remain profitable, as their selling price is more than three times their cost.

**Recommendations**:
1. **Restock Critical Ingredients:**  
   - Ben, the owner, should immediately replenish mozzarella, pizza dough, and tomato sauce to prevent disruptions in pizza production.  
   - Set reorder thresholds at **25% of stock for high-usage ingredients** so restocking occurs automatically before supplies run too low.  

2. **Monitor Ingredient Costs:**  
   - Ben should negotiate better pricing with suppliers on high-cost items like mozzarella and seafood. For example, ordering in bulk could lower the unit price.  
   - Compare prices from multiple suppliers for specialty cheeses to find the most cost-effective option without compromising quality.  

3. **Optimize Inventory Tracking:**  
   - Ben should conduct monthly inventory audits** to avoid errors in stock levels and better forecast future ingredient demand.  
   - Consider automating inventory tracking to receive alerts when ingredients fall below a certain threshold.  

4. **Promote High-Profit Pizzas:**  
   - Ben should focus on marketing the Seafood Pizza and Quattro Formaggi Pizza more aggressively** since they have high profit margins despite their production costs.  
   - Highlight these pizzas with ‚Äúpremium‚Äù labels or offer limited-time promotions to drive demand.

**Analysis**:
- Summary:
The staff performance and cost analysis for Ben‚Äôs Pizza reveal a total staff cost of $16.80K for 992 hours worked across morning and evening shifts. The sales generated during these shifts totaled $57.54K, with Team 1 outperforming other teams. The data underscores the need to balance staffing costs with sales contribution, optimize shift assignments, and identify underperforming roles or time slots.

1. **Staff Costs:**
   - Total Staff Cost: $16.80K for a total of 992 hours worked.
   - Evening shifts account for the highest expenses due to longer shift durations and higher hourly rates.

2. **Shift Analysis:**
   - Morning Shift: Lower cost due to shorter hours (maximum of 56 hours per shift).
   - Evening Shift: Higher cost due to longer hours (67.5 to 72 hours per shift).

3. **Sales Performance by Staff Teams:**
   - Top Performer: Team 1, generating $17.85K in total sales for the month, led by Arran Hodgson.
   - Team 4 lags behind, contributing the least to total sales.
     
4. **Shift vs. Day Performance:**
   - Sales peak during evening shifts, indicating higher customer traffic during dinner hours.
   - Monday and Sunday generate the highest revenue, while Wednesday sees the lowest sales, suggesting an opportunity to optimize operations midweek.

**Recommendations for Ben:**
1. **Optimize Staffing Costs:**
   - Reevaluate the distribution of high-cost evening shifts. Explore rotating evening roles to reduce individual staff expenses.
   - Analyze whether high-cost staff like Faraz Peck and Stan Black contribute proportionally to the sales they generate.
     
2. **Boost Midweek Sales:**
   - Introduce targeted midweek promotions or discounts to attract more customers on slower days like Wednesday and Thursday.
   - Offer staff incentives during low-performing shifts to boost morale and productivity.
     
3. **Balance Team Performance:**
   - Investigate the reasons behind Team 4‚Äôs lower performance. Provide additional support, such as skill development or adjusting roles, to improve their contribution.
   - Leverage insights from high-performing teams like Team 1 to replicate their success across other groups.
