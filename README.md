Ben is the proud owner of **Ben's Pizza**, a local favorite known for its delicious wood-fired pizzas and warm atmosphere. As part of his commitment to improving his business, Ben has asked us to analyze some key aspects of the pizzeria‚Äôs operations.

## Ben's Request

Ben has tasked us with analyzing various data points to help him make informed decisions about his pizzeria. He wants to know:

1. **Which items are the most popular** on the menu and how they correlate with customer orders.
2. **How much inventory** of each ingredient is used during the week and whether Ben needs to adjust his supply levels.
3. **Staff performance analysis**, looking at how shifts are scheduled and whether labor costs align with business needs.

## The Menu

Ben has an extensive menu with pizzas, sides, and drinks that are loved by the community. Below is the **menu** that we will be analyzing for business insights:

The menu offers a wide variety of pizzas with different sizes, toppings, and prices. Our analysis will help Ben understand which items are performing well and which might need adjustments based on customer preferences.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Sales Analysis**: Identify best-selling pizzas and top items on the menu.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Forecast ingredient usage based on sales patterns.
